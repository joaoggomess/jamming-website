Hello, I am jo√£o Gomes, and that's my first go on working with API trhough React. 

If you want to run the code you have to go to the Spotify for developers and get the api client Key,
you also have to put the local URI. Both changes are made in the spotify.js document.

I am continuosly improving some features of the App. If you have some hints on it, please let me know!

Youn can contact me on my e-mail or instagram @joaoggomess.
